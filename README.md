<h1 align="center"> Welcome to my Github profile </h1>

## TL;DR ##

I'm Alex, an enthusiastic **Junior Dev** (and reformed IT Recruiter)

Still quite new to this but I'm *loving* it

Right Now sharpening my skills on Ruby on Rails and Javascript


## Who's this? ##
   
Five random facts about me (two of them are false to keep this interesting): 
* Iâ€™m insecure about my beard
* Iâ€™m an undercover bear sent to learn human habits and customs 
* Love to cook, my meatballs are fiiiiiiine
* As I grow older, Iâ€™m becoming more and more addicted to socks 
* Iâ€™m learning the mandolin (the music instrument, not the one cutting vegetables) 

## But what? ##

Take a look at some of my (sometimes silly) projects:
