<h1 align="center"> Welcome to my Github profile </h1>

## TL;DR ##

I'm Alex, an enthusiastic **Full Stack Developer** (and reformed IT Recruiter)

## Who's this? ##
   
Five random facts about me (two of them are false to keep this interesting): 
* I’m insecure about my beard
* I’m an undercover bear sent to learn human habits and customs 
* Love to cook, my meatballs are fiiiiiiine
* As I grow older, I’m becoming more and more addicted to socks 
* I’m learning the mandolin (the music instrument, not the one cutting vegetables)
